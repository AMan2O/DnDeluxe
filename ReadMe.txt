The format for the Classes.txt file:

- A class name head that is 20 characters long:
eg
===================|
Barbarian          |

- A brief descriptor of what the class is like: (this will likely require Regex to limit the query)
eg

Barbarian          |A tanky and powerful melee fighter that uses their rage to overwhelm their foes!|

- The technical information that will be used when building the actual character sheet proper
eg

Barbarian          |A tanky and powerful melee fighter that uses their rage to overwhelm their foes!|HitDice = 12, Skills = 2,....
